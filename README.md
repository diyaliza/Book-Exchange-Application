# Book-Exchange-Application
A book exchange application built on Node JS and using Mongodb

The project is about building an application and making the best usage of middlewares. We are creating an application on NodeJS. The UI is rendered using EJS. We are using middlewares, especially for authentication. The application is a perfect demonstration of MERN stack. MongoDB is used as the database. The books are created and pushed into the MongoDB. The project utilizes Model View Controller architecture (MVC).
